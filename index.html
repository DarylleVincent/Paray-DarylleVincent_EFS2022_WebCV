         <h1>Hello! I am Darylle Vincent N. Paray. I was Born in July 3, 2000 at Medical City Hospital in Mandaluyong City. My Mom's name is Fritzie N. Paray and My Dad's name is Elmer B. Paray. I don't have any siblings and that is so boring because I don't have someone to talk to when my parents goes to work. Just a little brief about my educational background. I started school at 7 years old in Clip Learning Center. It is a small kindergarten school located in Makati. After passing preparatory level, I started my Grade school at Pembo Elementary School located also in Makati City but that only last for 3 years because we need to move to another house in Carmona, Cavite that's why I started my Grade 4 in Carmona Elementary School, I also graduated Elementary Level in that school. One of my best experience in that school is when i became a member of Drum and Lyre Team. After studying elementary, We transferred to another house in San Pedro, Laguna and that is our current house until now. I studied Junior High School in Upper Villages Christian Academy, I also finished my Senior High School level in that School. For me, that is my best school ever because that is a Christian School and when I started studying there, that school is the main reason why my life is close to God. The institution introduce God to me, not only me but each and every student at that School. And now, for my College level. I am currently studying 3rd year in  Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at Lyceum of Alabang located in Brgy. Tunasan, Muntinlupa City.</h1>

        <section id="skills"><h1>To be honest, I didn't like or want this course in the first place. I always dream of becoming a Multimedia Artist. I want to study something that is related to photography or film making but it didn't happen because of lack of finances but that is okay because I'm aiming to study that course when the right time comes. For me, it's not too late to study that as long as you are happy. I can say that my skills right now is all focused on studying Networking, something about Cisco Packet Tracer. I can also make a little bit of website but I'm not that good in that particular subject. I just want to survive this course because i want to catch my dream and that dream started when i was 15 years old.

        <section id="hobbies"><h1>One of my hobbies is playing instrument especially guitar. Before, when I was on my Junior and Senior High School level, Me and my Bandmates joined all 3 seasons of Battle of the Bands in Our School and thank God, we managed to get all those championships and special awards. I also served for God for 3 years in our school because I am a musician there and every friday, we have chapel service. After finishing Senior High School Level, My alma mater invited me to be a Judge in their Season 4 of Battle of the Bands, and that is the last time I played on stage with my Bandmates because that is around February before Covid strikes. I also experience playing on stage at Malayan Colleges in Cabuyao, Laguna and also in my current school, in Lyceum of Alabang in Muntinlupa City. I also play Bass Guitar but i sold it after 6 months because i needed money for my pc upgrade and now, my main focus is to learn piano but unfortunately, I don't have piano here in our house and I am only using piano online.</h1>
